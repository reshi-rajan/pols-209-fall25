# POLS 209: Introduction to Politcal Research Methods

[![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/x.png)](https://xkcd.com/2309/)

This repository contains course materials for my TA sections (908 & 910) for POLS 209 in FALL 2025. In this class, we learn how the basics of research design and methods in Political Science. In the lab sections I host on Fridays, we will use R and RStudio to work with data. Each week we will have an in-class activity we do for lab where I walk you through R code to teach you how to do the core components of your lab reports. Once we are done with class, I will post an answer key for each in-class activity. This code will remain here for you all to access throughout the semester and once our time in class is over.
