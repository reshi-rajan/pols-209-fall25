This week we will cover the second half of the regression lab. 

In particular, you should be able to do the following by the end of lab:
- Run a multi-variate regression
- Generate predicted values 
- Interpret interaction terms 

N.B. For 908 (10:55-11:45) we will not have much time to cover multi-variate regression, please see the annotated code for explinations and come to ask office hours/email me if you have more questions.
